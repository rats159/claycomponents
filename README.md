# A mediocre collection of Clay components
These components are designed to be as easy as possible to add (the only "boilerplate" is the context), but in exchange there's a lot of missing features.

## Pros Vs. Cons
|Pros|Cons|
|----|----|
|Elements don't require IDs|No element tracking outside of its own scope|
|No complex targeting system|No way to communicate with elements|
|No heavy element data structs|All state is managed by the user|
